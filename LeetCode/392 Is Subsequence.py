# Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

# A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: false

class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        sp, tp = 0, 0

        while tp < len(t) and sp < len(s):
            if s[sp] == t[tp]:
                sp += 1
            tp += 1

        return sp == len(s)
